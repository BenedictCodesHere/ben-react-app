I also demonstrated the use of modular code by creating a separate JavaScript file which essentially functioned as a router, redirecting the user to the correct selected theme page and storing this saved theme data on the client side, using localStorage."

        "description": "This project focused on API calls, allowing the user to search for the five-day weather forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API. The saved searches of the relevant cities were also populated to the page in the form of buttons, which would enable the user to click on a saved city to once again search for the weather (which would be an up-to-date forecast, as the API call would be a fresh one). I also utilised my CSS skills to create custom animated gradients, reflecting the changing dark-to-light circadian patterns of a day."
